Lesson plan

1. The basics

- what are HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- what does the server do, vs. what the client does
- hello world experiment
- what is a node?
- what are jsPsych plugins?

2. Simple experiment

- RT experiment
- 2AFC experiment
- Advanced: how to show RT as feedback

3. Some JavaScript

- walkthrough of a "vanilla" page that does something
  (show clock? pong game? scrolling text?)
- example of if-elseif-else
- example of while
- example of for
- example of functions

4. Generating nodes

- sometimes we want to make lots of similar nodes
- makes sense to use a loop to construct the nodes
- we can put it in a function too
- self-paced reading example

5. More complex example?

Stuff to cover later:

- key code mapping
