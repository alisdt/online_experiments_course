.. Lesson plan
   1. The basics
   - what are HTML / CSS / JavaScript
   - what does the server do, vs. what the client does
   - hello world experiment
   - what is a node?
   - what are jsPsych plugins?
   2. Simple experiment
   - RT experiment
   - Advanced: how to show RT as feedback
   3. Some JavaScript
   - walkthrough of a "vanilla" page that does something
     (show clock? pong game? scrolling text?)
   - example of if-elseif-else
   - example of while
   - example of for
   - example of functions
   4. Generating nodes
   - sometimes we want to make lots of similar nodes
   - makes sense to use a loop to construct the nodes
   - we can put it in a function too
   - self-paced reading example
   - 2AFC experiment
   5. More complex example?
