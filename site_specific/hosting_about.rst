-------

The teaching server used in this course is **not suitable** for real experiments.

Web hosting for your own experiments (for research, or for an undergraduate, MSc or PhD project) can be
requested using this form:

https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/audio-visual-multi-media/web-hosting/web-hosting-request-form

If you are a PhD student or member of staff, you may request hosting yourself.
If you are an Undergraduate or MSc student, please ask your supervisor to
complete the form. Note that (despite the question about cost on the form) we
are not charged individually for web hosting in PPLS.
