Hi,

Thanks for signing up for the Online Experiments workshop starting tomorrow. Here's some information you'll need in the class. (You don't need to do anything now -- please just have this email to hand in the class).

Materials for the class: http://softdev.ppls.ed.ac.uk/online_experiments/

If you have a Windows or Mac laptop, you'll be using the free CyberDuck software to connect to the server. Here are the download links; you could download it before the class if you have time:

Mac: https://update.cyberduck.io/Cyberduck-7.2.5.32097.zip

If you have a Linux laptop, we can advise you in the class about what you need to use.

Finally, you'll need the details below to log in to the server:

Cheers and hope to see you tomorrow,

Alisdair
