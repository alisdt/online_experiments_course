Hi all,

I'm running an Online Experiments course over one and a half days in Flexible Learning Week:

17th February, 9.00 to 17.00
18th February, 9.00 to 12.30

This is a long time to be working on programming so we'll take plenty of breaks. You'll need a laptop to take part, but if you don't have one please let me know and I'll have one ready for you to borrow.

This is open to all staff and students in PPLS, so please recommend it to anyone who will find it useful.

Here's all the info and a link to book your place:

Any questions, just ask.

Cheers,

Alisdair
