Solution 04 (code in its own file)
==================================

Presuming that you followed on from the exercise in section 02, you should
have a HTML file called `experiment.html` that looks like this:

.. code:: html

{{ s04_experiment_html }}

and a JavaScript file called `experiment.js` that looks like this:

.. code:: javascript

{{ s04_experiment_js }}

As before this may differ in small details like the file paths.

Remember that for this to work the image file must also be in the same folder.
