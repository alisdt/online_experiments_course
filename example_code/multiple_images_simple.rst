Multiple images
===============

This code uses ``image-keyboard-response``, so make sure it's included in your
``experiment.html``.

.. code:: javascript

{{ s04_multi_image_experiment_js }}

As before the images you use will need to be in the folder alongside your code.

You'll also need `experiment.html` but this will be the same as in the previous
exercise.
