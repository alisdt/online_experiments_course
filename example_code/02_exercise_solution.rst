Solution 02
===========

`experiment.html` should contain something like this:

.. code:: html

{{ s02_experiment_html }}

In this example, the image (`nasa_proxima.png`) should be in the same folder as
`experiment.html`.

Your code may be different depending on where you have uploaded jsPsych and
what your image is called, so if your code doesn't work check these first.
